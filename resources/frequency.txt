834
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:16,523
But he murdered three women, all nurses,
between '68 and '69.

835
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,108
They call him the Nightingale.

836
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,527
Nightingale?
We've been watching that on the news.

837
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,905
- I was worried about your mother. She said...
- Dad, we did something.

838
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,407
Something to make it worse.

839
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,995
- I don't understand.
- He didn't just kill three women anymore.

840
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,165
He's killed 10.
Something we did changed the past.

841
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,375
- But how come your mother...?
- Think about it.

842
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:39,546
Everything you did is different than if
you'd never gotten out of that warehouse.

843
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,840
Now, what did you do last night, Dad?

844
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:46,803
I talked to you, I put you on the bike...

845
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:51,183
...I tucked you in at Gordo's and I went
to see your mother over at the hospital.

846
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,684
Oh, shit.

847
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,270
That's it.
She wasn't supposed to be there.

848
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,440
Butch got her. It was the night of the fire.
He brought her home.

849
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,318
- Something happened at the hospital?
- That's the beginning.

850
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:05,280
It could've been anywhere, place, time
that she wouldn't have been if you'd died.

851
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,200
I'll take her away from here.
I have to take her away from...

852
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,369
- He cannot hurt her if I take her away.
- What about the others?

853
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,914
What about the others, Dad?

854
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:17,000
- I'll warn them.
- It'll never work. They'll think you're crazy.

855
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:20,462
But I gotta do something. You
don't even know what this guy looks like.

856
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,049
- You don't know who he is.
- No, because nobody got any...

857
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,426
Hold on. Wait a minute.

858
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,055
Dad, I may not know who he is...

859
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:34,059
...but I know where he's gonna be and what
he's gonna do before he gets there.

860
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,062
What do I do? Call the police?
They're not gonna believe me.

861
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:40,565
They will if they catch him in the act.
You can make that happen.

862
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,025
No, Johnny. I don't know.

863
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,946
- I don't know. I'm a firefighter, not a cop.
- I'm a cop. This is what I do.

864
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,739
This is something we have to do.

866
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,327
- If I can't reach you?
- Get Mom the hell out.

867
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:56,206
But, Dad, those other women
were not supposed to die.

868
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,708
If we don't do something to try
to stop this guy...

869
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,837
...we're gonna have to live with that
for the rest of our lives.

870
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,673
Okay.

- All right.

The next victim is Carrie Reynolds.
It happens tomorrow.

873
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:14,182
Case file says
she left the Roosevelt Hospital at 6...

874
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,393
...showed up at Cozy's Bar around 6:30...

875
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,312
...she walked out of that bar
around 7:30...

876
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,441
...and they found her dead
in an alley behind the bar at 8:00.

877
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:27,279
I want you to follow her, see if anybody's
watching her or hitting on her...

878
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,115
...because I'm betting
when she walks out of that place...

879
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,117
...somebody's gonna come out with her.

880
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,828
